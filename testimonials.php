            <p>Divorce is a horrible process and is never a pleasant experience to go through, especially for someone with children; however, 
               when I met the Fox Law team in November 2011, I received nothing but efficient and accurate legal advice, complete support, and honesty.  
               I never felt like 'just another case.'  
               The Fox Law team treated me like family throughout my case and continues to do so.
            </p>
            <p>From the very first time I walked through the door, <a href="<?=$root?>/about/margo_fox.php">Margo Fox</a> took her time with me, listened to every concern I had, 
               and assisted me with pursuing the goals I had for myself and for my family post-divorce.  
               My case required a contested hearing at one point; however, Margo and her paralegal, <a href="<?=$root?>/about/rene_hibbard.php">Rene Hibbard</a>, 
               displayed incredible strengths outside and inside the courtroom, so I knew that I was in good hands. 
            </p>
            <p>While this process was incredibly difficult, the friendly phone calls to check up on me 
               and the encouraging emails I received on a daily basis made it a little easier for me to stay focused on what was best for me and my children. 
               To recommend this team to someone would be an understatement, but if you are looking for a legal team who has your best interest at heart, 
               and the knowledge to back it up, you should definitely consider Fox Law.  
               If you will listen to Margo's advice and take advantage of the team's guidance and sincere concern for your well-being, you will come out of your experience better than when you arrived.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks again for making me feel like family.</p>

            <p>Margo Fox represented me through the duration of my divorce.   
              I have the utmost respect for Ms. Fox and her extensive knowledge of family law and the court system in Williamson County. 
              Ms. Fox was straightforward, honest, and thorough, telling me what I needed to know and fully preparing me for all scenarios, both good and bad. 
              I felt completely supported throughout the divorce process and had constant communication and access to Ms. Fox for any questions or concerns I had.   
              The staff at Fox Law is exceptional, especially her senior paralegal, Rene Hibbard.

            <p>I knew the second I met Margo Fox that she was going to take care of my divorce as well as me and my children.  
               She definitely has calming effect and passed along those feelings to me.  
               Margo is very knowledgeable of both family law and the Williamson Country legal system.  
               She assured me that everything would work out - and it did!
            </p>
            <p>Margo took over my case from another lawyer after an unsuccessful mediation with the opposing side.  
               Between Rene Hibbard and Margo - 
               they quickly got up to speed on the case, understood the background and my needs and requests.  
               They immediately began working with the opposing counsel in hopes of coming to an agreement.  
               Their communication skills are fantastic and I definitely felt as if I was part of the team - but not doing their work for them.  
               Margo was very open with me regarding my requests which I could attain and others where I really needed to follow the Texas Family Code.  
               I appreciated her honestly and it helped to understand what was realistic and what was not.
            </p>
            <p>Margo and her staff were very attentive to my needs and quick to answer my questions.  
               I never felt put off or that my case wasn't as important as her other cases.   
               Margo and Rene supported me through my divorce and helped me to get where I am now ... stronger, happier and confident that it will all be better.

               they were both awesome. 
               They both helped me through some very tense divorce procedures and also had a taste of what I went through. 
               For that I thank you for everything and appreciate experience I've never been through before and hope I don't go through again. 
               I have recommended several friends to Margo and will continue to do so.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks so much and so glad I was recommended by my job to you!</p>

            <p>Anyone having gone through a divorce knows how trying it can be.  
               There are a lot of emotions that occur; some of which you might not have known existed within you.
            </p>
            <p><a href="collaborative_law.php">The collaborative process</a> was a welcome one!  
               A team was formed to help with all aspects of the process (attorney representing both sides, a financial advisor and a mental health specialist),
               all of which were quite helpful in moving the process along with the end result being a 'healthy relationship' rather than one with angst.
            </p>
            <p>For me personally, I was that 'wife' that had pretty much nothing to do with the financial aspect of our marriage besides paying bills so the learning process for me was an emotional,
               frustrating long haul.  
               But because of the collaborative process I was able to take the necessary time and schedule with experts to help me understand the world of finances 
               before I had to make decisions regarding that aspect of the divorce.  
               I can't say that I know all there is to know and it will be an on-going learning process for me as different times in my life approach 
               but as for the divorce, I feel comfortable with the decisions I made and that in the end the two of us felt a sense of fairness 
               which has lead us to the friendly relationship that we maintain today.  
               I'm not sure this could have been accomplished outside of the collaborative way!
            </p>
            <p>Thank you all at Fox Law!</p>

            </p>
            <p>I can't tell you how much I appreciate your time, dedication, faith and services over the past year and a half.  
               Your expertise, negotiating skills, responsiveness and your caring attitude was a blessing to me through difficult times. 
            </p>
            <p>I know this was a drawn out divorce, but you handled everything with  professionalism and courtesy for both parties - and I really appreciate that. </p>
            <p>I can honestly say, without a doubt, you are the best law team and the best people I have ever been around.</p>
