    <h4>Why Am I Here?</h4>
    <p>In approximately 2002, God put it on my heart to begin a career in family law.  
     From the very beginning, I was blessed with well-respected, knowledgeable, and loving attorneys as my employers and mentors.   
     However, over the years I became increasingly tired of the constant hatred and unconstructive behavior that family law cases so often bred.  
     I felt like I was reliving my parent's ugly divorce on a day to day basis and the stress of seeing families rip themselves apart was literally making me sick. 
     Because of this, for about the first 7 years of my career, I wasn't so sure I was in the right place, but I trusted God's reasons for leading me to this type of work and continued on.  
     While I always felt mutual respect with our clients and regularly received positive feedback for our work performed, I wanted more.  
     The transactional approach to assisting with the practice of law was boring.  
     I wanted God to use me in this space to be something for our clients that was far greater than the work of a paralegal.  
     Simply put, I'm here because people matter much to God and as a follower of Christ that means people and their families should matter much to me.  
     And they do.  
     When I am finished with this career, I want to be able to look back and know that I made a difference in the lives of our clients and in the lives of their children.  
     No one wins in family law, but you can come out at the end of a case looking forward instead of backwards and on your way to an extraordinary life.   
     God has great plans for you and it is my hope and prayer that the relationship you will have with our firm will reach far beyond the doors of our office.     
    </p>
    
    <h4>Role in Firm</h4>
    <p>As the firm's Senior Paralegal, I assist the firm with a large majority of our most litigious family law cases, collaborative law cases, and uncontested cases.  
     My primary job duties include the drafting of legal documents, preparation for mediations and hearings, assistance in the courtroom, client meetings, and consistent client communication.
     I am, what you would call, the &quot;Type A,&quot; of the office.  
     Organization, efficiency, and accuracy are extremely important to me.   
    </p>
    
    <h4>Educational Background</h4>
    <p>I graduated with honors from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in May 2000 where I received my Bachelor of Business Administration 
     and competed for the UMass Women's Gymnastics Team for four years.  
     I started my paralegal career in 2002 and graduated with honors from the University of Texas Legal Assistant Program in September 2003.  
     I am currently a member of the Capital Area Paralegal Association 
     and a former volunteer for CASA where I was a guardian ad litem for abused and neglected children in Travis County from 2002 through 2004.     
    </p>
    
    <h4>Family and Other Interests</h4>
    <p>I have been married to my husband, Rob, since 2004 and we have two daughters.  
       Rob and I enjoy spending time with our friends and family and we are actively involved in our church, Hill Country Bible Church.
