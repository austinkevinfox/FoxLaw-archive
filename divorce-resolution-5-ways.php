  <p>Number one is often done pro se which means without legal counsel.  
     These are the do-it-yourself divorces typically.  
     Numbers 2, 3, &amp; 4 can be done with 2 lawyers, 1 lawyer, or no lawyers on either side.  
     Our firm's practice of Number 5, Collaborative Law, requires that both parties have attorneys, plus a mental health professional (MHP), and possibly a financial professional (FP).  
     Our firm believes very strongly that Collaborative Law is THE best option for most of our clients.  
     Because Collaborative Law has not received much press, we are working to bring this amazing process to the public's attention.  
     Our goal is that every client coming to us on a family law matter has already heard about Collaborative Law before they contact our firm - even if they choose not to go the Collaborative route.
