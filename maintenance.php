        <p>Maintenance and spousal support are legal terms for income provided by one spouse or former spouse to 
          the other during a separation and/or after divorce. Maintenance/spousal 
          support is awarded to a spouse if he or she needs financial assistance 
          and the other is able to provide it. Maintenance/spousal support is, 
          by law, temporary unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
