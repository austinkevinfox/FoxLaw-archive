    <h2>Darcy Miller</h2>
    <h3>Business Manager</h3>
          <p><img class="bio shadow" src="/images/Darcy.jpg" alt="Darcy Miller, Business Manager"/>
             Darcy is the Business Manager for Fox Law.  
             Darcy was born in Fullerton, California, but grew up in Reno, Nevada.  
             She received her Master's in Business Administration from the University of Nevada, Reno.  
             After working for many years for a large health system, Darcy now enjoys the slower pace and environment that a small firm provides.  
          </p>
          <p>In December 2008, Darcy relocated from Nevada to Central Texas with her husband and three children.  
             By moving to Texas, they felt that they could offer more educational opportunities and a different environment to their kids.  
             All three kids are very active with multiple sports (including baseball, football, volleyball, golf and cross country/track) and activities, 
             creating a very busy schedule when Darcy is not at work.  
             When there is some down time, Darcy enjoys spending it with her family at the Round Rock Express games, out on the boat, 
             or traveling with her family to different parts of the country to ski, kayak, or any other adventure her family can think of.
