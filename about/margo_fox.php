          Margo is an Attorney &amp; Counselor at Law and Mediator. She has represented 
          and counseled a wide variety of clients in state law and federal law 
          matters including <a href="/family_law/">family law</a>, bankruptcy, probate and estate administration, 
          estate planning, tax and property law, contract law and business transactions, 
          corporate law and oil and gas, and appellate law. 
          </p>
          <p><a href="http://www.tbls.org/Directory/Attorney.aspx" target="_blank">Board Certified in Family Law</a> 
          by the <a href="http://www.tbls.org" target="_blank">Texas Board of Legal Specialization</a>, 
          Margo primarily practices family law, including cases involving divorce, modifications and adoptions. 
          In addition to litigating cases, she practices collaborative law, a solution-oriented alternative to traditional divorce. 
          The essence of collaborative law is the shared 
          belief of the participants that it is in the best interest of the parties 
          and their family to commit themselves to resolving their differences 
          with minimal conflict. She is a member of The Collaborative Law Group 
          of Austin, a collaborative law practice group of attorneys that practice 
          and promote a collaborative process for problem solving and peaceful 
          resolution of family law issues. 
          </p>

          modification of parental rights, consumer transactions, and contract 
          disputes.
          </p>
          <p>Fox Law, PLLC, formerly known as Davis &amp; Fox, PLLC, 
          was formed in April of 2006. Prior to forming her own practice, Margo
